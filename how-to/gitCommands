Git Commands - Basics
-----------------------------------------------

## Here are the basic commands you will be using 90% of the time:
## This is the checkout command
##      the -b means its a new branch
##      if you do not need a new branch, you can remove the -b
##      mdr_branchName is the branch's name
##      Here is our schema: initials_whatYouAreDoing_WhereYouAreDoingIt
##          Examples: mdr_loginPage_Frontend
git checkout -b mdr_branchName

## This is one of the branch commands
##      the -D means delete the following branch
git branch -D mdr_branchName

## This is the fetch command
##      the -a means get everything
git fetch -a

## This is a push command
##  this will push everything you have committed in your current branch to the repo
git push

## You should never alter main, always checkout main and create a branch from it
## To set up a new branch, follow these steps

##  1st: we are going to checkout a temp branch
git checkout -b temp

##  2nd: we are going to do delete the main branch
##      Why, because we want the most recent changes pushed to the repo
##      the -f will force the deletion
git branch -D main -f

##  3rd: we get everything from the cloud repo
git fetch -a

##  4th: we checkout our main branch which has been updated
##      we have to recreated it because we do not have a local copy of it
git checkout -b main

##  5th: we create our new branch
git checkout -b mdr_finishingSetup

##  6th: push our new branch
git push

##  You are going to get an error that looks like this
PS C:\Dev\Projects\ltfg> git push
fatal: The current branch mdr_finishingSetup has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin mdr_finishingSetup
