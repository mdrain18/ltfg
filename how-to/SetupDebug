       -- Wait for it to finish

    b. Select "Angular Application" and press the "Debug" icon"

       -- You should hit your breakpoint
       -- Press the "Continue" button (or F9)

    c. If it works, Pull Run -> Stop -> Stop All


 6. Rename the IntelliJ debug option from "Application" to "Backend"
    a. Go to the backend/src/main/java/com/lessons/Application
    b. Right-click on the Application.main -> Debug 'Application.main()'
    c. Verify that the backend is listening on port 8080
       1) Open a browser
       2) Connect to http://localhost:8080/ltfg/api/time
          -- You should see the time

    d. Pull Run / Stop Application

    e. Rename this configuration from "Application" to "backend"
       1) Pull Run / Edit Configurations...

       3) On the Right side,
          Name:  Backend
       4) Press Apply
       5) Press OK


 7. Setup the multirun plugin (so that you can debug the application with one click)
    a. Install the multirun plugin
       1) Pull File -> Settings
       2) Click Plugins
       3) In the Plugins search box, type-in multirun
       4) Click the "install" button [on the right side]
       5) You will be prompted, "JetBrains is not responsible for any processing of your personal data by any third-party plugin vendors"
          Click Accept
       6) Restart IntelliJ

    b. Configure a MultiRun configuration to kick off the backend, the Angular CLI Server, *and* the Angular Application configurations
	   1) Pull Run -> Edit Configurations
	   2) Press +  ->  MultiRun

	   3) In the window on the right
             Name:  Full WebApp

             Under "Choose configurations to run",
               press +  Backend
               press +  Angular CLI Server
               press +  Angular Application

             Check    "Start configurations one by one" with delay of 9 seconds
             Uncheck  "Mark the tab of failed configuration"
             Uncheck  "Close tab of successfully completed configurations"
             Check    "Allow re-using tabs with succeeded run configurations"
             Check    "Allow re-using tabs with failed run configurations"


             NOTE:  Make sure the order is the same order as listed above
                    We want the backend to start *first*

        3) Press Apply

	      -- You should see the time

    d. Pull Run / Stop MultiRun
